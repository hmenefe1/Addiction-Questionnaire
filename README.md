# Addiction-Severity-with-Accountability
Questionnaire to help detect if addict needs intervention by means of alerting a set individual for accountability.

Will try to go off of the ASI (Addiction Severity Index) for questions/ratings. Person answering the questions will have answers sent to an accountablity partner. If score is high, then the person notified of answers can help take the necessary steps to avoid a relapse of the person's addiction.
