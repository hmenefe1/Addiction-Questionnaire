# Addiction-Severity-with-Accountability
Questionnaire to help detect if addict needs intervention by means of alerting a set individual for accountability.

Will go off of the ASI (Addiction Severity Index) for questions/ratings. 
UPDATE: The questions may be pared down due to the number on the actual ASI and some not transferring over to work with the code.

Idea is to have an accountability parter that will be alerted of answers by person taking the questionnaire. If score is above a certain score, then the person notified of answers can help take the necessary steps to avoid a relapse of the person's addiction or to help them seek help before relapsing via therapy or doctors visit.

UPDATE: Since the ASI has many questions broken down into different categories, I'm considering spliting the code into different addictions. This way the user can pick what they are personally battling addiction with - and they can have the option to choose more than one.
