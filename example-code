Code example from https://github.com/ksu-hmi/Depression-Detection-w-Accountability 

Will follow the code used for questionnaire but will use questions pulled from the ASI 5th edition pdf (https://www.bu.edu/igsw/online-courses/substanceabuse/AddictionSeverityIndex,5thedition.pdf) to help shape the questions and also how the answers are rated.
